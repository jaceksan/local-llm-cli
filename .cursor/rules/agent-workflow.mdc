description: Agent workflow + guardrails for this repo
alwaysApply: true

## Workflow

- Follow the existing design in this repo; don’t reinvent patterns.
- After implementing a user request, validate the result (e.g. run `ruff`).
- Do not commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.
- Stop after completing one task/change-set and ask whether it should be committed before continuing to the next task.
- If fixing something introduced by an earlier local (not-yet-pushed) commit, prefer a fixup-style commit.

## Code changes

- Keep diffs small and focused.
- Prefer robust correctness first; optimize only after correctness is verified.
